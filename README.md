# Database Driven Client-Server Application

## Overview

This application is a database driven client-server application made using Java and Maven. The application is designed to simulate an education platform, with various tables such as Course, Student, Instructor, Enrollment, Assignment, and Submission.

## Database
The application uses a MySQL database to store all data. The database has six tables, namely Course, Student, Instructor, Enrollment, Assignment, and Submission.

## Features
The application consists of several menus, including Course Menu, Instructor Menu, and Student Menu, which allow users to perform various operations on the respective tables. Some of the features offered by the menus are:

1. Find all objects
2. Find objects by ID or filter
3. Insert new objects
4. Delete objects
5. Get objects as JSON

Apart from the tables, the application also has a Client Menu, which allows users to perform similar operations on the Course and Instructor tables.
